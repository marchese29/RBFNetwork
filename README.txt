data/generator.py
This is the file that generates the random data sampling based off of the provided sine function.

data/points.pkl
A serialized file containing the data points generated by generator.py

driver.py
This is the file that runs all of the testing and validation logic.  It also contains the code that
generates the plots that are shown in the report.

networks/rbfnetwork.py
This is the file that contains the logic behind the actual RBF Network that this project is supposed
to implement.  It contains one class that represents a single RBF Network whose architecture is
determined by its input parameters.

results.txt
Some raw output from the script (contains mean-squared errors that are in the tables of the final
report).

util/kmeans.py
This is the logic for finding where to place the centers for the gaussian functions that we are
approximating.  It is implemented using the K-Means algorithm.

Execution
=========
To re-generate the test data, cd into the data folder and run the following command:
> python generator.py

To run the entire program, cd to the root of the project and run the following command:
> python driver.py

Credits
=======
This project takes advantage of two open-source libraries:
- Numpy - http://www.numpy.org/
    Used for generating inputs used in the plots generated by the script.
- matplotlib - http://matplotlib.org/
    Used to generate the plots that are shown in the final report.
